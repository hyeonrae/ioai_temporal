# Code stuff for IOAI (temporay repository)

This is a temporary repository for storing sub-works of intra-oral projects.

The code you can get here is incomplete and unstable.

Sooner or later this space will be deleted and the correct code will be updated in the official repositories (github.com/hyeonrae/ioai).
